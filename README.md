# payroll-management-system

This is a Payroll Management System. Users can add records, remove records, modify records, delete records, or search records. The salary records (salary statement and salary slip) can also be displayed for all employees.

I have attached two files- <code> EPLOYEE_FILE.txt </code> and <code> MONTHLY_PAY_DEC_2020.txt </code> for reference and better understanding.
